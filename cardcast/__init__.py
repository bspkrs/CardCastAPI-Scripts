# ADDITIONAL NOTE FROM THE DEVELOPERS OF CARDCASTGAME.COM ON THE USE OF THEIR API
#
# The Cardcast API isn't public, but we (the developers of cardcastgame.com) don't
# have a problem with people tapping into it for small projects.
#
# Our only requirements (right now) are:
#
# A) Make users aware you are using Cardcast decks.
# B) Direct users to our website for any searching/discovery of play codes
#    (i.e., don't roll your own search engine based on our data).
# C) If possible, implement some simple form of caching. The decks aren't immutable
#    (people can edit decks at anytime and the code remains the same), so you
#    shouldn't cache a deck for too long. One popular site caches for 15 minutes.
# D) Use at your own risk! If cardcastgame.com goes down or is hacked or whatever,
#    we (the developers of cardcastgame.com) can't be held liable for any impact on
#    your app. We also reserve the right to revoke access at anytime.
